# Project NFT Search
## Introduction

NFT Search is an AI-driven cross-modal search engine based on semantic understanding. As a fundamental infrastructure for Web3.0, it allows users to perform token-level searches across hundreds of millions of NFTs using just textual descriptions or image prompts. Leveraging this powerful engine, we also offer personalized NFT recommendations and counterfeit NFT detection, enhancing user experience and security in the digital asset space.
