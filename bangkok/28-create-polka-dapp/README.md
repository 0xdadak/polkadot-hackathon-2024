# Create Polka Dapp

Create Polka Dapp is a simple to use CLI that helps Developers scaffold started polkadot applications. Currently it only creates frontends with a connect wallet functionality.

This project is being developed as part of the Polkadot Hackathon 2024 (Singapore/Bangkok). The main code repository is available [here](https://github.com/OpeOginni/create-polka-dapp/tree/polkadot-2024-hackathon).

The Pull Request will explain the existing features of the project and the features that will be added and worked on during the hackathon.

As new commits are made on the original repo I will be updating them on this README.
