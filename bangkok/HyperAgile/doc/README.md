# Folder Descriptions
- src/: This is the main source folder where the core application logic resides.
- components/: Contains reusable React components that are used across the application. Each component is generally placed in its own file for modularity and maintainability.
- utils/: Helper functions and utilities that provide reusable functionality, such as data formatting, API response parsing, etc.
- services/: Handles communication with external APIs or databases. This is where you'll find modules for making API requests, like authentication or fetching data.
- tests/: Contains all test files for the project. Each file typically mirrors the structure of the src folder, with unit and integration tests for components and services.
- README.md: The project documentation file. This file contains an overview of the project, setup instructions, and additional resources for contributors.
