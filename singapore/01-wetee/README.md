# Project WeTEE
## Introduction
WeTEE is a user-friendly and secure computational power infrastructure for Web3. It utilizes decentralized trusted computing power in a cloud-like manner and provides hardware-level security assurance for Web3 applications and DeAI.

WeTEE utilizes privacy-preserving computation to provide universal computing power for the Polkadot ecosystem, allowing all web2 applications to be deployed at zero cost into a decentralized privacy computing environment, transforming them into TEE applications. This makes confidential computing effortlessly simple.

WeTEE also offers a TEE Bridge to facilitate interoperability between smart contracts and trusted applications, enabling Polkadot smart contracts to achieve functional expansion through TEE applications. This makes smart contracts omnipotent.
