# Transaction Analyzer

Transaction Analyzer is an inteligent all-in-one tool for ensuring user safety.
1) forks the desired chain
2) simulates the extrinsic
3) analyses all events emmited by the extrinsic
4) shows the analysed info in simple to understand way to users. UX is improtant to us.

Without good UX, good safety is meaningless. Our goal is to achieve both!
