# Double Pendulum

Double pendulum is one of many problems in physics leading to effect named deterministic chaos (you may heard of it as butterfly effect). 
It means that the equations describing its motion are so sensitive to initial conditions, that even the slightest change in them leads after some time to completely different trajectoreies. 

My project combines this physical principle with world of crypto by creating set of NFTs displaying motion of multiple double pendulums in cute and colorful way. 
The innovation isn't only in its base in physics, but also the user can change said initial conditions and colors to create their own completely original animated NFT.
