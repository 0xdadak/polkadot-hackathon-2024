## Avatar Accounts

**Avatar Accounts** is a tool designed for Substrate-based chains, allowing Ethereum users to access and interact with their applications by simply signing a message.

It creates a keyless Substrate account that operates on Substrate chains, capable of executing any pallet extrinsic calls, while being entirely controlled by the Ethereum userâ€™s externally owned account.

This innovation enables Ethereum users to effortlessly explore and utilize the unique features and capabilities of Substrate chains (Parachains) without any extra steps on their end.
