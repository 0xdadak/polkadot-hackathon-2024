Project Name: PolkaShare

Idea: Decentralized Cross-Chain File and Data Sharing

Overview:
PolkaShare is a decentralized file and data-sharing platform that allows users to securely store, share, and manage files across multiple blockchains within the Polkadot ecosystem. The platform enables users to maintain privacy and control over their data while benefiting from the scalability, security, and interoperability of Polkadot's multi-chain architecture.
